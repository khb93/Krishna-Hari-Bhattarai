<h1>Krishna Hari Bhattarai</h1>
<div>
<p><p><p>As an experienced independent consultant, I have dedicated my professional career to combating poverty and illiteracy in rural communities of Nepal through collaborating with international non-profits. With a Master's Degree in Business from Tribhuvan University and a range of successful projects in Tanahun, Sinchupalchowk, Kathmandu, and Gorkha districts, I am passionate about creating meaningful and sustainable change in the lives of those in need. 
<div>
<p>I have developed a range of school projects, such as constructing school buildings, offering teacher training, providing annual scholarships to merit-based and economically vulnerable children, and finding sister schools for our rural public schools in Spain. In addition, I have implemented community development programs to improve the livelihoods of farmers. This includes cultivating fruit and vegetables, constructing greenhouses, providing career-driven vocational training, supplying advanced agricultural tools, and offering organic agricultural training programs. We concurrently pursue these projects to improve the education and empowerment of local villagers through income-generating projects.

    <p>We also provided relief to those affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake who had fled from Sindhupalchowk and taken refuge in a camp in Boudha, Kathmandu. We constructed 18 shelters for over 250 villagers, as well as providing basic facilities and helping the children of the camp join Samata School by providing educational materials, uniforms, stationery items, and other necessary supplies. We select projects through a set of school and community needs assessments to ensure the best use of resources for the target group.
<div>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we established "Khana Sabailai Social Project" – a sustainable social enterprise in Kathmandu – to provide free balanced meals to daily pay laborers in Kathmandu, in collaboration with a non-profit. We fed daily around four hundred porters, construction workers, elderly, physically challenged, single women, street vendors, and other daily pay workers throughout the entire lock-down period. The project continues to offer a quality meal to the target group at the lowest possible price.
<div>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, reading, and listening to music. I have found true joy in helping those in need. If you'd like to learn more, please email me at kisuuna@gmail.com. Thank you!<div>
