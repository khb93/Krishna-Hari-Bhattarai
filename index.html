<h1>Krishna Hari Bhattarai</h1>
<p>I am a social worker. I collaborate with non-profits for combating poverty and illiteracy in rural communities of Nepal. I have been implementing different programs in Tanahun, Sinchupalchowk, Kathmandu and Gorkha districts. I did a Master's Degree in Business from Tribhuvan University. Construction of school buildings, offering teacher's training, providing annual scholarships to merit based and economically vulnerable children, development of different aspects of public schools, finding sister schools for our rural public schools in Spain are some of the school projects that I have been implementing.</p>
<div>
<p>Apart from school programs, I also implement community development programs in order to enhance the livelihoods of farmers. Cultivation of fruit and vegetable, construction of greenhouses, providing career driven vocational training, as well as advanced agricultural tools and organic agricultural training programs are some project activities I have been implementing. These line of projects are carried out simueltaneously in order to improve the education and empowerment of local villagers through income generating projects.  </p>
<div>
<p>We also did some relief projects by helping the 2015 Nepal earthquake survivors who fled from Sindhupalchowk and resided in a camp in Boudha, Kathmandu. 18 shelters were constructed for over 250 villagers who shared the camp. Apart from providing basic facilities to them, we also helped the children of the camp to join Samata School by providing educational materials, uniforms, stationery items and other necessary supplies. The projects are identified and selected through a set of school and community needs assessments. This helps us to address the most cruical community needs thereby ensuring the best utilization of resources for the target group. </p>
<div>
<p>During COVID 19, we established "Khana Sabailai Social Project" a sustainable social enterprise in Kathmandu. This provided free balanced meal to the daily pay laborers in Kathmandu in collaboration with a non-profit. The meals were provided to around four hundred porters, construction workers, elderly, physically challenged, single women, street vendors and many other daily pay workers throughout the entire lock-down period. Even today, this enterprise continues to offer a qualitative meal to the target group at a least possible price. </p>
<div>
<p>Apart from social service, I like travelling, reading, and listening to music a lot. I have realized the joy of giving. Helping the needy gives utmost satisfaction to me. </p>
