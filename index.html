    <div>Independent Consultant, Nepal<div>

            <div>
<p><p><p>My name is Krishna. I am an experienced independent consultant with a commitment to combatting poverty and illiteracy in rural communities of Nepal. I have a Master's Degree in Business from Tribhuvan University and have undertaken successful projects in Tanahun, Sinchupalchowk, Kathmandu, and Gorkha districts. I am passionate about creating meaningful and sustainable change in the lives of those in need.<p>
    <div>
<p>Through my work, I have developed several school projects, such as constructing schools, providing teacher training, offering annual scholarships to economically vulnerable children, and connecting our rural public schools with sister schools in Spain.<p>

<p>Secondly, we create community based organizations(CBOs) in order to carry out our community development programs. This program is aimed at improving the livelihoods of farmers. This includes cultivation of fruit saplings,  improvement of kitchen garden by cultivating seasonal and off-seaasonal vegetables, constructing greenhouses fitted with gravity based drip irrigation, providing career-driven vocational training, providing advanced agricultural tools, and offering organic agricultural training. Apart from that, the income generating projects such as providing machinery and tools for the production of noodles, weaving and knitting of woolen garments are also supported in a few communities. We concurrently pursue these projects to improve the education and empowerment of local villagers through income-generating projects.<p>

             <p>My work also extends to providing relief to those affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake who had fled from Sindhupalchowk and taken in a camp. Eighteen temporary shelters were constructed for over 250 villagers in Boudha, Kathmandu. This also consisted of providing basic facilities and helping the children of the camp join Samata School by providing educational materials, uniforms, stationery items, and other necessary supplies.<p>
            <div>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we established "Khana Sabailai Social Project" – a sustainable social enterprise in Kathmandu – to provide free balanced meals to daily pay laborers in Kathmandu, in collaboration with a non-profit. We fed daily around four hundred porters, construction workers, elderly, physically challenged, single women, street vendors, and other daily pay workers throughout the entire lock-down period. The project continues to offer a quality meal to the target group at the lowest possible price.<p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, reading, and listening to music. I have found true joy in helping those in need. If you'd like to learn more, please email me at kisuuna@gmail.com. Thank you!<p>
