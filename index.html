                <p class="masthead-subheading font-weight-light mb-0">I am a social worker combating poverty and illiteracy since 2015. I have been contributing the rural communities through the implementation of different programs in Tanahun, Sinchupalchowk, Kathmandu and Gorkha in collaboration with a non-profit. I did a Master's Degree in Business and Finance from Tribhuvan University. As a social worker, I carry out the construction of school buildings, offer teacher's training, provide annual scholarships to merit based and economically vulnerable children, develop of different aspects of public schools, find sister schools for our rural public schools in Spain. </p>

Apart from school programs, I also implement community development program in order to empower of villagers and enhance their livelihoods by carrying out fruit and vegetable cultivation, construction of greenhouses, provide many career driven vocational training, as well as advanced agricultural tools and organic agricultural training programs. These line of projects are carried out simueltaneously in order to improve the education and empowerment of local villagers through income generating projects. We also did some relief projects by helping the earthquake survivors who fled from Sindhupalchowk and resided in a camp in Boudha, Kathmandu. The 18 shelters were constructed for over 250 villagers who shared the camp. Apart from providing basic facilities to them, we also helped the children of the camp to join Samata School by providing educational materials, uniforms, stationery items and other necessary supplies. The projects are identified and selected through a set of school and community needs assessments. This helps to address the most cruical community needs thereby ensuring the best utilization of resources for the target group. </p>

During COVID 19, we established "Khana Sabailai Social Project" a sustainable social enterprise in Kathmandu. This provided free balanced meal to the daily pay laborers in Kathmandu in collaboration with a non-profit. The meals were provided to around four hundred porters, construction workers, elderly, physically challenged, single women, street vendors and many other daily pay workers throughout the entire lock-down period. Even today, this enterprise continues to offer a qualitative meal to the target group at a least possible price. </p>

Apart from social service, I like travelling, reading, and listening to music a lot. I have realized the joy of giving. Helping to the needy gives utmost satisfaction to me. </p>
